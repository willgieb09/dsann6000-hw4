# DSAN 6000 Homework 4: Working With Columnar Data in DuckDB

**Due Friday, October 2, 11:59pm EDT**

> [!WARNING]
> If you have cloned the repository **template** from the `https://github.com/jpowerj/dsan6000-hw04` URL, you are **not starting the assignment correctly!** That is, if the command you used to clone the repo onto EC2 looks like:
> 
> `git clone https://github.com/jpowerj/dsan6000-hw04`
> 
> This will **not work** for assignments in this course, since you **will not be able to push your changes** back to this repository! (Notice how the above code purposefully has *no copy button!*) Instead, you need to create your **own *private* version of the template** (shared with instructors only), as described in the next section.

### Creating Your Own *Private* Repo From the Template

Click the **green "Use this template" button** in the upper-right corner of the template repo on GitHub, then choose the "Create a new repository" option. On the next page, you will be able to create a **new repository** in **your own GitHub account**. Follow these steps to set up your new private repository:

1.  Within the **"1. General"** section, call it **`dsan6000-hw04`** (the same name as the template), and
1.  Within the **"2. Configuration"** section, choose **Private**
1.  Click the green **Create Repository** button
1.  Once the repository has been created, open the **Settings** page linked at the top of the GitHub interface
1.  In the menu on the left side of the Settings page, within the **"Access"** section, click **"Collaborators"**
1.  Use the **"Manage access"** portion of this Collaborators page to add the course instructors via our GitHub usernames, given in the following table:

<table>
<thead>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Jeff</td>
<td>
  
```
jpowerj
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Samyu</td>
<td>

```
samyu-vakkalanka
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fangzhou</td>
<td>

```
fangzhou-wang
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Siru</td>
<td>

```
siruwuu
```

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Once this **derived** private repository has been set up on **your GitHub account**, and you have added the instructors as collaborators, you are all set up to **submit the URL for your newly-created repository on Canvas!** Please submit the URL immediately after creating the repo: this is what will allow us to see your progress and check any issues between distribution and submission.

Then, once you have submitted the URL on Canvas, **clone *your* newly-created repository (*not* the template owned by `jpowerj`) to your EC2 instance to begin working!** In other words, the command you run on EC2 should look as follows (with your GitHub username in place of `YOUR_GH_USERNAME`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GH_USERNAME/dsan6000-hw04
```

Note that this and other `git` commands interacting with your GitHub repository will likely require you to use a GitHub **Access Token** in place of your password (despite the fact that `git` will ask you for your password, the password you use to log into your GitHub account in your browser typically will *not* work within the `git` command-line interface).

To create this Access Token, **follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)**: you can just check off all permissions (since this is a case of you "granting" permissions to yourself – you would need to worry about specific permissions if you were granting access to a coworker on a project, for example!), and you don't need to choose an expiration date for this Access Token (though you can for extra account security).

## HW4 Task: Optimizing Queries on ACLED (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data) Events

For this assignment you will be working with a dataset (that Jeff contributed to at some point long ago!), the full set of publicly-available [ACLED events](https://acleddata.com/) involving civilian casualties, spanning from January 1, 1997 to September 26, 2025<a name='fn1loc'></a><sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>.

This dataset was chosen for this assignment because it helps illustrate the **OnLine Analytics Processing (OLAP) "stage"** that we're moving towards in this second unit of the course: although the event information recorded in this dataset may stream **into** ACLED's database row-by-row, when it comes time to **analyze** it

> [!NOTE]
> ### Setting Up Your `uv` Environment
> 
> In this class, to ensure that the Python libraries necessary for each assignment are installed on your EC2 instance, we will be using the [`uv` package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Setting up `uv` and then activating the environment works as follows:
> 
> 1.  If you have not yet installed `uv` on your EC2 instance, run the following command within VSCode's Integrated Terminal:
> 
>     ```bash
>     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
>     ```
> 2.  With `uv` installed, within the cloned homework directory, just type `uv sync`, and `uv` will create a new Python environment (within a subdirectory it will create, called `.venv`) where all libraries necessary for this assignment are automatically installed.
> 3.  Once the `uv sync` command has finished running, **activate** the created environment by executing
> 
>     ```
>     source .venv/bin/activate`
>     ```
> 4. If the environment was activated successfully, the command prompt in VSCode's Integrated Terminal should now have a `(dsan6000-hw04)` prefix. That is, the prompt should look like:
> 
>     ```bash
>     (dsan6000-hw04) ubuntu@ip-172-31-78-63:~/dsan6000-hw04$ 
>     ```
>     
>     Instead of
>     
>     ```
>     ubuntu@ip-172-31-78-63:~/dsan6000-hw04$ 
>     ```
> 
> 5.  What we've done thus far means that you could now run "plain" `.py` files, and the necessary libraries would be ready for use. However, since we want to utilize **Jupyter notebooks** to write our code, we need to register this environment as a **kernel** that Jupyter can use to execute the code you write within Jupyter notebook code cells. To achieve this, we'll need the `ipykernel` library, which you should now install within your `uv` environment by executing the following command:
> 
>     ```bash
>     uv pip install ipykernel
>     ```
> 
> 6.  Once `ipykernel` has been installed within your `uv` environment, the final step is to **register** this `uv` environment with Jupyter, so that it can be chosen as your desired environment within Jupyter (rather than the default "base" Python environment). To achieve this, execute the following command:
> 
>     ```bash
>     python -m ipykernel install --user --name=hw04-kernel
>     ```
> 7. Once this command has executed successfully, your assignment-specific `uv` environment is now ready for use as a Jupyter kernel! Unfortunately, the only way to get VSCode to detect this new kernel (so that it appears as an option when you choose the kernel for a Jupyter notebook) is by reloading VSCode. But, rather than closing the window and reconnecting, there's an easier approach! Oen the VSCode **Command Palette** using `Ctrl+Shift+P`, then start typing "Reload". You should see the full set of commands filter as you type, leaving the option **"Developer: Reload Window"** near the top. Click this command and your window should reload in the same state, but now with your kernel detected by VSCode.

The remaining instructions are given in a single Jupyter notebook:

* In `DSAN6000_HW4.ipynb` you will get your first hands-on experience with the **internals** of the `.parquet` columnar data storage format, especially its use of **Run-Length Encoding (RLE) compression** for massive file-size reduction. Then you will **take advantage of** these `.parquet` enhancements (relative to `.csv`), by querying a `.parquet` file *directly* from within an S3 bucket, loading only the data needed to execute the query (a massive improvement over the necessity, with `.csv` files, to load the entire file before issuing queries).

## HW4 Submission

Since you submitted your GitHub URL all the way up at the top of the instructions, all that is left is for you to **push your work from EC2 to GitHub**. If you push a commit with the commit message **"Final submission"** (by running `git commit -m "Final submission"` and then `git push`), we will consider your repo ready to grade – otherwise, if no commit with this message is found, we will consider the **most recent commit when the due date is reached** to be your final submission.

<a name="fn1">1</a>. ACLED's publicly-available event database uses a 1-year "lag", for data quality purposes: additional information about a given event often becomes available in the days/weeks after its occurrence, so, ACLED finalizes its record of a given event after a year. Since I queried their database on September 26, 2026, the events up to and including September 26, 2025 were returned. [↩︎](#fn1loc)
